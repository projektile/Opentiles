Opentiles
=========

A simple tiling feature for openbox.
This was written in python for Crunchbang Linux with Openbox wm; it depends on wmctrl and xdotool and given dependencies are met, should work with other window managers and distributions (untested).
It will compensate for size and location of conky and your task panel (assuming you don't have conky floating in the middle of the desktop).
Currently tiles in two unique ways and will rotate when the same windows are tiled repeatedly. Works best when mapped to two keys.

Update. working on a second version of this with faster api's and more accurate placement mechanisms, however I've abandoned ship on openbox so I won't finish it for a while.
