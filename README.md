Opentiles
=========

A simple tiling feature for openbox. 
This was written in python for Crunchbang Linux with Openbox wm, though it should work with many window managers.
It will compensate for conky, however I'm having trouble making it compensate for the task panel when placed on the bottom of the desktop.
Currently tiles in two ways; no rotating feature has yet been implemented. Works best when mapped to two keys.
you can see how it works here:
