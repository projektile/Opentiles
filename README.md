Opentiles
=========

A simple tiling feature for openbox. 
This was written in python for Crunchbang Linux with Openbox wm; it depends on wmctrl and xdotool and given dependencies are met, should work with many window managers (untested).
It will compensate for conky and your task panel, both in dimensions and coordinates.
Currently tiles in two ways and will rotate the when the same windows are tiled repeatedly. Works best when mapped to two keys. Currently only tiles in two columns, currently working changing this and implementing column limits of 3 windows.
you can see how it works here:
